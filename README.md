# php-form-job-application
This is a php/html project that contains two php files.

The first is an application form (jobapplication.php) where job candidates have to fill the form with the informations requested. If all sections are filled correctly it is shown the sentence: "Candidatura inviata con successo!" ("Application sent successfully!").
I used XAMPP to run the file on browser, saving the file in the folder "xampp/htdocs" and executing the page typing localhost/jobapplication.php on browser.
These are some screenshots of how the jobapplication.php page looks and works:

The second (jobadmin.php) dispalys the table "myapplicants" that is a database stored in localhost/phpmyadmin (a web-platform where you can create database using sql) that I create. The page is connected to the database and display always what in the database is stored in, and permits the user to apply filters obtaining new tables. 
I runned the file on browser just as descripted before.
