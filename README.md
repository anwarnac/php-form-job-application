# php-form-job-application
This a simple php project where a I developed an application form (jobapplication.php) where candidates fill the form with the informations needed,
that are sent to the jobadmin page (jobadmin.php), that collect applications from candidates in a table and can apply filters to select the right candidates.
I used XAMPP and phpmyadmin to store data sent by applicants and access it from the jobadmin page.

This is an a screenshot of the jobapplication.php page filled with some informations candidate that is been submitted:

and this is how it looks and works the jobadmin.php page:
