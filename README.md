# php-form-job-application
This is a php/html project that contains two php files.

The first is an application form (jobapplication.php) where job candidates has to fill the form with the informations requested. If all sections are filled correctly it is shown the sentence: "Candidatura inviata con successo!" ("Application sent successfully!").
I used XAMPP to run the file on browser, saving the file in the folder "xampp/htdocs" and executing the page typing localhost/jobapplication.php on browser.
This some screenshots of how the jobapplication.php page looks and works:
